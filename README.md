# Superstore-Sales-Dataset
## Project Overview ##
This project involves a deep-dive analysis of thr Superstore Dataset. Using **Microsoft Excel**, I transformed over 9,700 rows of transaactional data into an interactive Dashboard.

The goal was to move beyong "just looking at numbers" and instead identify the specific drivers of revenue, regional strengths, and seasonal trends to support data-driven decision-making.

## Business Problem ##  
Retailers often to see the "bigger pictures" within large volume of daily transactions. For this project, I addressed three core business problems.  
1. **Regional Blindspots:** Which regions are underperforming and require a strategy pivot?
2. **Category Distribution:** Do we diversify or we are over-reliant on one product category?
3. **Operational Efficiency:** Does our shipping mode selection correlate with higher revenue?

## My Analytical Workflow (The "Excel-First" Approach) ##  
- **Data Integrity:** After importing my dataset into Excel, I duplicated it into a new worksheet, cleaned the dataset by standardizing the date formats of the Order and Ship and addressing missing values in geographic fields (Postal Codes) before organizing it into a structured table.
- **Aggregation:** I built a robust back-end using **Pivot Tables** to calculate the KPIs (Total Revenue, Total Orders and the likes). 
- Using consistent color palettes, aligned visuals, and **Slicers** to make the dashboard intuitive for non-technical managers.
